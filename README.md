# My personal cheat sheet.
I use this repository as a note to self with (a string of) commands and code. Either to remind me of known stuff or teach myself new stuff.

## Structure
The structure for this repo is as follows:
- The language or framework (f.e. GIT / Java)
  - [optional] sub language/framework (f.e. Spring / Kotlin)
  - README.MD
